The API here is pretty straightforward.  The requests take parameters 
(for now GET or POST, either works) and return JSON.

- All pages return a JSON object with the key 'succeeded' as either 0 
(false) or 1 (true)
- list.php takes no arguments and returns all notes that are in the 
database.
- add_note.php takes arguments:
    - device_id, a GUID/UUID
    - author, the name of the user who submitted the note
    - location, a free-form text field for the user's location
    - note, the note to be added.
